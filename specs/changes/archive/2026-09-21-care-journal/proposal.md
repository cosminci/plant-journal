# Care journal — plants and their dated care log

**Date:** 2026-09-15

## What

A browsable care journal for the household's plants.

- One row per active plant: fixed attributes (species, nickname, location), current substrate (a component mix), and recent operations.
- Operations can be logged and edited.
- Plant status is persisted for later archived-plant support.
- Controlled vocabulary (substrate components, action-types, moisture levels) is English; free text is preserved verbatim.

`Substrate`, enforced at construction:

- Non-empty; components distinct; shares each a `Percentage` (1–100).
- Shares total at most 100 — a shortfall is an unspecified remainder, not an error.
- Rejected: total over 100, a repeated component, an empty mix.

A plant owns its current substrate, which matches the substrate of its greatest-date repot; operation timestamps are immutable, backend-generated, and unique within a plant, so a newly recorded repot is the latest repot without reading operation history. Logging and editing workflows are serialized so their writes, plant synchronization, and compensation cannot interleave. Recording always writes the operation first, then a repot updates the plant substrate; a failed post-write plant read or update removes the new repot. Amending always writes the editable operation details first; if the operation is the latest repot, the journal then updates the plant substrate. A failed post-edit read or plant update restores the previous operation. The overall operation fails, and a failed compensation is also reported while retaining both causes. Editing an older repot does not update the plant. Ordinary care operations leave the mix unchanged. Reads return the stored mix without reconstructing it from operation history.

Plants are not deleted. Every operation belongs to an existing plant and cannot outlive it. Operations have no user-facing deletion capability; store-level removal exists only to compensate a failed repot log.

Persistence keeps common operation metadata relational: a constrained `kind` column identifies the care or repot variant, while a valid-JSON `payload` column contains only that variant's fields. This keeps the schema queryable and constrained without modelling variants as one nullable-field product or coupling its shape to the domain model.

`PlantJournal` captures its store, identifier generator, and clock, making their authority explicit in the journal value's type and preventing it from escaping a shorter-lived capability scope.

## HTTP

- `GET /plants` returns active plants; `GET /plants/{plantId}/operations` returns that plant's operations.
- `POST /plants/{plantId}/operations` accepts care or repot details and returns the backend-generated operation identifier with `201 Created`.
- `PUT /operations/{operationId}` accepts care or repot details and returns the edited operation. A missing operation is `404 Not Found`; attempting to change its variant is `409 Conflict`.
- Wire operation details are discriminated by a lower-camel-case `kind`; enum values use the lower-camel-case names documented by the frontend model. Invalid variants, enum values, percentages, or substrate mixes are `400 Bad Request`.
- Journal read, logging, corruption, and persistence failures are `500 Internal Server Error` without exposing internal exception details.
- The Tapir endpoint definitions are the source of the generated OpenAPI contract.

## Frontend

Hexagonal, like the backend:

- Mirrors the backend domain one-to-one: branded ids/scalars, the same ADTs, and a `JournalClient` port whose methods match `PlantJournal` (async over the sync backend).
- Components depend on the port, never a concrete HTTP client; one adapter implements it, mapping transport errors into the `*Failed` result cases.
- Wire shapes are single-sourced from the OpenAPI contract — nothing hand-duplicated; components test against a stub of the port.
- A repot carries the new mix, so the mix editor lives in the operation form, not a separate screen.
- Archived-plant retrieval and presentation are deferred; the UI shows active plants only.

## Acceptance criteria

- Active plants: one row each. Row shows species, location, nickname, and current substrate (component mix with percentages).
- Row shows the three most recent operations, oldest→newest, one cell each; a new operation shifts the row, keeping the latest three. A care cell reads `date — moisture level — action(s)`; a repot cell identifies the repot and its new mix. Notes are appended when present.
- Add via a form: a care-operation type and optional note. The backend assigns the immutable operation timestamp when logging. A care operation records a moisture level and zero or more action-types, allowing a moisture-only observation. A repot captures a required new substrate mix (components distinct, shares ≤ 100). Saving a latest repot records it, then updates the plant's current substrate.
- Editable operation-detail fields use the same form; operation type, identifier, plant, and timestamp are immutable. Editing the latest repot updates the plant's current substrate after its details are saved; editing an older repot leaves the plant unchanged.
- Operations cannot be deleted by users, because each records care that has already happened. A newly written repot is removed only when compensating a failed current-substrate update.
- A care operation cannot carry a substrate mix; a repot always carries one.
- Substrate changes only via a repot — no standalone editor; the row reflects the plant's persisted current mix.
- Logging a repot succeeds only when both the operation and the plant's current substrate match the resulting greatest-date repot. If the post-write plant read or substrate update fails, the new operation is removed and logging reports failure.
- Editing the latest repot succeeds only when both its amended details and the plant's current substrate are persisted. A pre-write read failure changes nothing; if the post-write substrate update fails, the previous operation is restored and editing reports failure. Editing an older repot never updates the plant.
- Logging and editing operation workflows do not interleave; one completes its synchronization or compensation before another begins.
- If repot compensation also fails, the overall failure reports both causes rather than returning success.
- An edit cannot change an operation between care and repot.
- Attempting to change an operation between care and repot reports an operation-type mismatch without changing the journal.
- Stored operation timestamps and care/repot details round-trip, with a relational discriminator and variant-specific JSON payload. Database constraints reject malformed JSON payloads and unknown discriminators; store reads report schema-accepted malformed timestamps, required fields, enum values, and substrates as attributed corruption rather than valid domain values, accumulating independent failures within and across rows.
- Collection reads validate every persisted row before visibility filtering and report every corruption together, with each cause attributed to its plant or operation identifier; valid archived plants remain hidden, while malformed status data is never silently omitted.
- A missing plant or operation is reported as `RecordMissing`, distinct from a successful single-record read.
- Collection reads never report `RecordMissing`; an empty journal, including the operation log requested for an unknown plant, is `Read(Vector.empty)`.
- Database access failures are reported separately from stored-data corruption.
> **Scope revision — 2026-09-21:** The one-time household-spreadsheet import is deferred until editable care catalogs exist, so the importer targets the final persisted catalog model rather than the temporary enum-backed vocabulary.

## Tradeoffs accepted

- Compensation can itself fail after the primary substrate-update failure. The journal reports both causes explicitly; automated repair beyond the immediate compensation attempt and process-crash recovery between saga steps are deferred.

## Out of scope

- Archived-plant retrieval and presentation.
- Sorting the bounded household collections in persistence; the frontend sorts them for display.

## Doc Sync

- GLOSSARY.md — Plant, Location, Operation (replacing "Action"), Substrate, Substrate-component, Moisture-level, Action-type, Nickname, active/archived status, English-vocabulary + preserved-free-text handling.
- specs/design.md — service overview, domain model, processing rules, edge cases, invariants (substrate shares ≤ 100; English handling); component diagram.
- contracts.md — points at both, restating neither: `contract/openapi.yaml` (HTTP API) and the database schema (versioned Flyway migrations folder).
- specs/testing.md — testing methodology and test-type naming (unit, seam-integration); no system-integration tier here.
- specs/operational.md — runtime dependencies: on-disk SQLite (schema applied by migrations at startup); how the frontend is served and reaches the backend.
