Derive plant attention from bounded watering history and publish it for presentation and future metrics export.

## What & Why

- Active plants are ordered by display name in the browser; watering cadence, attention classification, and attention ordering are not modelled.
- The backend will own materialized attention measurements through a vendor-neutral read port. The browser will order and present those measurements; a future metrics adapter can consume them without UI ordering semantics.

## Domain / Design Notes

```scala
final case class AttentionProjection(measuredAt: Instant, plants: Vector[PlantAttention])
final case class PlantAttention(plant: Plant, watering: WateringAttention)
type WateringSampleCount = Int :| Interval.Closed[0, 20]
type WateringSampleSize = Int :| Interval.Closed[1, 20]
type OperationPageSize = Int :| Interval.Closed[1, 10]

sealed trait WateringAttention:
  def sampleCount: WateringSampleCount

object WateringAttention:
  final case class Unavailable(sampleCount: WateringSampleCount, maybeElapsed: Option[FiniteDuration]) extends WateringAttention

  sealed trait Available extends WateringAttention:
    def averageInterval: FiniteDuration
    def elapsed: FiniteDuration

  final case class Current(sampleCount: WateringSampleCount, averageInterval: FiniteDuration, elapsed: FiniteDuration) extends Available
  final case class Overdue(sampleCount: WateringSampleCount, averageInterval: FiniteDuration, elapsed: FiniteDuration) extends Available
  final case class RedAlert(sampleCount: WateringSampleCount, averageInterval: FiniteDuration, elapsed: FiniteDuration) extends Available

enum RefreshAttentionResult:
  case Refreshed(projection: AttentionProjection)
  case RefreshFailed(reason: Throwable)

trait PlantAttentionMonitor:
  def current: AttentionProjection
  def refreshAll: RefreshAttentionResult

trait PlantAttentionStore:
  def getAttentionSamples(size: WateringSampleSize): GetAttentionSamplesResult
```

- `WateringSampleCount` is 0–20. The attention-owned persistence port reads every active Plant together with up to the requested number of its watering dates. Watering selection, timestamp-descending order, identifier tie-break, and the per-plant limit are part of that domain-facing contract. SQLite returns one row per Plant and uses the operation index to seek each active Plant's bounded recent history.
- Plant values are shared domain concepts. Journal mutation and retrieval contracts, attention persistence reads, and attention calculation and projection contracts remain separate subdomains. A persistence adapter may implement both subdomain ports without making either domain depend on the other.
- Watering attention uses the latest 5–20 watering-selected operations. Fewer than five is unavailable; otherwise the average is the arithmetic mean of consecutive timestamps.
- `WateringAttention` is the complete classification: `Current` through the average interval, `Overdue` immediately after it, and `RedAlert` at average plus 24 hours. `Unavailable` cannot carry an overdue or warning classification.
- Browser ordering derives the exact elapsed/average ratio from scored attention rather than receiving a second urgency classification. A zero average sorts as zero attention at zero elapsed and unbounded attention after time advances.
- Browser ordering is unavailable attention first, then scored attention by the derived ratio descending. Ties use location, species, nickname with absence before presence, then plant identifier, all ascending.
- Attention is materialized during startup and recomputed every five minutes. Startup failure aborts the application; later failure retains the prior measurement. Journal changes become visible on the next recomputation, and publication replaces the snapshot atomically.
- HTTP translates attention outside the core without adding presentation order. The browser reads it on load and after a successful operation save; a future metrics adapter can read the same port without determining scrape versus push now.

## Invariants

- Recent cards still request three unfiltered operations; history still requests up to ten unfiltered operations per page with existing ordering, defaults, and failure behavior.
- Journal persistence, compensation, mutation serialization, and focus restoration remain unchanged.
- HTTP and future metrics models stay outside the core domain.

## Tradeoffs Accepted

- Materialization adds bounded background work and can lag wall time by up to five minutes. A failed refresh does not roll back a successful journal mutation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Cadence results are correct for fewer than 5, exactly 5, and more than 20 qualifying waterings; non-watering care and repots are excluded before the 20-operation limit.
- Equal timestamps produce deterministic attention values. In the browser, unknown plants precede scored plants; higher urgency precedes lower urgency; and urgency ties use the defined plant-field order, placing recently watered scored plants near the bottom.
- At the average interval a plant is current; immediately after it is overdue; immediately below average plus 24 hours it remains overdue; at and above that threshold it is red alert. Unknown cadence has no overdue or red-alert state.
- Startup and each five-minute interval publish a newly measured complete projection, including watering logs and edits that changed stored qualifying operations since the prior measurement. Startup failure aborts the application; a later refresh failure never exposes a partial projection.
- The browser orders attention values and preserves backend state. Each card presents a compact attention column before its summary: a same-sized round status icon for unknown cadence, current, overdue, or red alert; an applicable `in` time until watering or `late` overdue duration; and an information control. Mixed day-and-hour durations have no space between their units. Current is green, overdue is yellow/orange, and red alert is red with a cross, with text and accessible names preserving the state distinction independently of color.
- Hovering or focusing the attention information control exposes the classification inputs not otherwise shown: qualifying watering sample count, inferred average in natural language when available, and projection evaluation age calculated from the browser clock. Unavailable cadence instead explains that there are insufficient watering operations. Card controls, keyboard focus, desktop layout, and landscape-mobile layout remain usable after reorder.
- The operation-read API remains bounded for all callers. The attention read port contains measurement time and one watering classification carrying its applicable sample count, average interval, and elapsed time, without metrics-vendor dependencies.

## Doc Sync

- `GLOSSARY.md` — define plant attention, watering cadence, urgency, overdue, and red alert.
- `specs/design.md` — Domain model, Processing rules, Edge cases, and Component architecture for attention and its future metrics seam.

## Out of Scope

- VictoriaMetrics export, configuration, export scheduling, scrape/push choice, and adapters.
- Predictive cadence models beyond the arithmetic mean.
