# Archive substrate components and pesticides

**Date:** 2026-09-25

Let a household retire a substrate component or pesticide it no longer uses, guarded by the same irreversible-action confirmation used for archiving a plant.

## What & Why

- Substrate components and pesticides can be added and edited but never retired; a previously deferred plan for removal would delete the record outright and reject the attempt while it is still referenced, which was never built.
- Editing an existing substrate component or pesticide gains an adjacent, explicit archive action that permanently retires it after confirmation. A plant's current substrate mix and any logged operation's recorded pesticides keep referencing and displaying an archived entry unchanged, since removing the record itself would break those existing references; only new use is excluded.

## Domain / Design Notes

- `SubstrateComponent` and `Pesticide` each gain their own `status`, each with its own enum:

  ```scala
  enum SubstrateComponentStatus derives CanEqual:
    case Active, Archived

  enum PesticideStatus derives CanEqual:
    case Active, Archived

  final case class SubstrateComponent(id: SubstrateComponentId, data: SubstrateComponentData, status: SubstrateComponentStatus)
  final case class Pesticide(id: PesticideId, data: PesticideData, status: PesticideStatus)
  ```

- A substrate component and a pesticide each gain their own archive action and outcome: success, an unknown identity, an already-archived entry, or a failed write. The two catalogs stay independent of each other; nothing new couples them together.
- Neither the `substrate_component` nor the `pesticide` table has a status column today. A new Flyway migration adds one to each, mirroring the existing `plant.status` column and check constraint:

  ```sql
  alter table substrate_component add column status text not null default 'Active' check (status in ('Active', 'Archived'));
  alter table pesticide add column status text not null default 'Active' check (status in ('Active', 'Archived'));
  ```

- Reading a catalog continues to return every entry regardless of status, so a plant's mix or an operation's pesticides can still resolve and display an archived entry's name and notes. Validating a new repot's substrate or a new care operation's pesticides accepts only active entries; an archived one is treated the same as an unknown one for that validation.
- An archived substrate component or pesticide is no longer editable, mirroring an archived plant.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Editing an active substrate component or pesticide shows an explicit archive action beside save, matching the placement used for an operation's delete action. Editing an already-archived one shows its archived status instead, with no save or archive action offered.
- Activating archive opens a keyboard-accessible confirmation with a prominent warning symbol and explicit text that archiving is permanent, matching the plant-archive and operation-delete confirmation: focus trap; cancelling or pressing Escape leaves the entry unchanged and restores focus; no restoration is offered.
- Confirming archive marks the entry archived and closes its editor; any usage site offering it for new selection stops listing it, while every plant and operation that already references it keeps displaying it unchanged.
- Saving a new repot's substrate or a new care operation's pesticides that references an archived entry, including a form opened before it was archived, fails without recording it.
- A stale or repeated archive confirmation on an already-archived entry, an unknown entry, or a write failure leaves recorded state unchanged and displays a meaningful error without reporting success.

## Doc Sync

- `specs/design.md` — Domain model: substrate components and pesticides gain their own active/archived status, matching a plant's status shape but not sharing its type; archiving excludes an entry from new repot and care-operation validation and locks it from further edits, while existing references keep resolving and displaying it unchanged.

## Out of Scope

- Restoring an archived substrate component or pesticide.
- Hard-deleting a substrate component or pesticide outright.
