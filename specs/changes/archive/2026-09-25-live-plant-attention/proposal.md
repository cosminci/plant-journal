# Live plant attention

> Standard: [Agentic Engineering Standards](https://github.com/Adobe-AIFoundations/agentic-workflow-standards) v1.2.0.
**Date:** 2026-09-25

Push attention to the browser over a WebSocket instead of polling, and stop letting attention block the journal.

## What & Why

- Today: attention materializes once at startup (startup aborts if that fails) and recomputes every five minutes. The browser reads it via `GET /attention` on load and after every mutation. A plant missing from the snapshot falls back to a client-computed watering count; the journal — including the active/archived toggle — fails to load if that count reaches five, or if any other read fails.
- New: attention recomputes every 30 seconds and is pushed to every connected browser over a WebSocket; the browser stops requesting it. Startup no longer waits on or aborts for the first computation. A plant the browser hasn't received attention for yet shows a pending indicator instead of failing the journal or falling back to a client-computed count; the garden/cemetery view and the toggle render independently of attention.

## Domain / Design Notes

- `PlantAttentionMonitor.make` takes its recompute interval as a parameter, and the monitor owns its own recompute schedule; the composition root no longer runs a separate polling loop with the interval baked in. `current`, `refreshAll`, and attention computation and classification are unchanged.
- The interval is a static default of 30 seconds. Making it overridable at runtime (for example by environment variable) is future scope; every environment uses the same default for now.
- The frontend now holds an open WebSocket connection to the backend. Each time the monitor's current projection changes, the backend pushes it down every open connection; this is a push adapter around the existing monitor, not a new domain port or type.
- Pending is a browser-side fact, not a monitor state: a plant absent from the projection the browser has received is pending for that plant. The monitor never represents "pending."

## Invariants

- Watering cadence classification (unavailable, current, overdue, red alert) and its 5–20 sample bounds are unchanged.
- Browser ordering of scored plants (unavailable first, then urgency ratio, then the existing tie-break order) is unchanged.
- Recent-card and paginated-history operation-read bounds are unchanged.

## Tradeoffs Accepted

- Startup no longer aborts when the attention store is broken; every active plant instead stays pending until the store recovers.
- Recomputing ten times more often adds background read load, and each connected browser holds an open connection instead of one-shot reads; both are acceptable at household scale.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Attention recomputes every 30 seconds; each recomputation reaches every connected browser through the WebSocket push, with no polling.
- A browser that connects or reconnects receives the last computed projection immediately if one exists, then every later update.
- Backend startup succeeds and serves plants, operations, substrates, and pesticides even before attention has ever been computed, or while its store is unavailable.
- The garden/cemetery view, the active/archived toggle, and the add-plant control render as soon as plant, operation, substrate, and pesticide data load, regardless of attention state; the journal fails to load only for a plant, operation, substrate, or pesticide read failure, or a projection with a duplicated plant identifier or a plant outside the active set — never for a missing or pending attention entry.
- Each active plant not yet covered by the browser's received attention shows an animated, accessibly labeled pending indicator in its leftmost column instead of a status icon, replaced in place the moment its entry arrives, honoring reduced motion; during a dropped connection a plant keeps its last known attention instead of reverting to pending.
- The journal header shows an accessibly labeled "Backend" connection indicator among the header actions, before the add-plant control and visible even before the journal loads, reflecting whether the WebSocket connection to the backend is currently up and showing the elapsed time since the last attention update it received (an awaiting state until the first update arrives).

## Doc Sync

- `specs/design.md` — Use cases and workflows: change the `Monitor -->|complete snapshot| Browser` diagram edge to a WebSocket push, and drop "an initial attention read must succeed to serve the app," which is no longer true.
- `specs/contracts.md` — Contract inventory: add a row for the WebSocket attention feed between browser and backend, a second protocol surface alongside the HTTP API and not covered by the generated OpenAPI.

## Out of Scope

- Runtime overrides (e.g. environment variables) for the recompute interval; a static default is used for now.
- Any change to watering cadence classification math or sample bounds.
