# Externalize business and deployment configuration

> Standard: [Agentic Engineering Standards](https://github.com/Adobe-AIFoundations/agentic-workflow-standards) v1.2.0.
**Date:** 2026-09-29

**Classification:** feature

**Grounded in:** Spiked two ways to load configuration: hand-written parsing on top of Typesafe Config, versus PureConfig's declarative case-class mapping. PureConfig's squants and Iron integration modules covered every value shape in use today, including the refined watering-count bound, with no hand-written glue.

One validated configuration surface replaces hardcoded thresholds and scattered, ad hoc environment parsing.

## What & Why

Today:

- Watering minimum sample count and history size, the overdue grace period, the attention recompute interval, and photo upload/thumbnail size caps are hardcoded. Changing any needs a code change and a rebuild.
- The watering history behind that average is capped at 20 records, with no way to widen or narrow it.
- Network host/port and deployment paths are each read from their own environment variable, parsed ad hoc, with an inline fallback, even where the path can never vary independently of the container it ships in.
- `/health` reports a build version alongside its liveness status, coupling an operational liveness check to release tracking.

New:

- Every field an operator can legitimately want to change at deploy time gets a named environment variable, with a fallback default matching today's value.
- Every field that can't vary independently of the container it ships in is fixed in configuration, with no environment variable at all.
- The 20-record cap is removed. An operator can configure any window of 2 or more records.
- Every environment-sourced setting is validated once, together, at startup, not parsed case by case as each is first needed.
- Every environment variable name drops its current app-name prefix; the app has nothing else to disambiguate from.
- `/health` reports liveness only. The application-version concept is removed outright, not folded into the configuration surface.

## Domain / Design Notes

Every configuration field is declared in one place. Only some are overridable; the rest are fixed.

**Fixed** — declared with a hardcoded value, never read from the environment:

- Storage lock-contention timeout and attention-feed connection-staleness threshold: unchanged from today.
- Database file path, photos directory, and static assets directory: unchanged from today. Each is a container-internal path that only the volume mount above it can meaningfully vary; none is an independent operator decision.

**Overridable** — sourced from the named environment variable when present and non-empty, otherwise the documented default:

| Field | Environment variable | Default | Bound |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Network bind host | `HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | non-empty (unchanged) |
| Network bind port | `PORT` | `8080` | non-empty (unchanged) |
| Watering minimum sample count | `WATERING_MIN_SAMPLE_COUNT` | 5 | 2 or more |
| Watering history size | `WATERING_HISTORY_SIZE` | 20 | ≥ the configured minimum, no upper limit |
| Watering overdue grace period | `WATERING_OVERDUE_GRACE_PERIOD` | 24h | greater than zero |
| Attention recompute interval | `ATTENTION_RECOMPUTE_INTERVAL` | 30s | greater than zero |
| Photo maximum upload size | `PHOTO_MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE` | 20MiB | greater than zero |
| Photo maximum thumbnail size | `PHOTO_MAX_THUMBNAIL_SIZE` | 100KiB | greater than zero |

- Minimum's floor is 2: averaging needs at least two dates to produce one interval.
- Below the minimum, watering is reported unavailable, not computed from too little data.
- The window is otherwise unbounded — it holds whatever the configured history size requests.

`application.conf`, in full:

```hocon
gardening {
  server {
    host = "0.0.0.0"
    host = ${?HOST}
    port = 8080
    port = ${?PORT}
    static-dir = "/app/static"
  }

  storage {
    db-path = "/data/gardening.db"
    lock-timeout = 5s
    photos-dir = "/photos"
  }

  attention {
    feed-staleness-threshold = 5s
    recompute-interval = 30s
    recompute-interval = ${?ATTENTION_RECOMPUTE_INTERVAL}

    watering {
      min-sample-count = 5
      min-sample-count = ${?WATERING_MIN_SAMPLE_COUNT}
      history-size = 20
      history-size = ${?WATERING_HISTORY_SIZE}
      overdue-grace-period = 24h
      overdue-grace-period = ${?WATERING_OVERDUE_GRACE_PERIOD}
    }
  }

  photo {
    max-upload-size = 20MiB
    max-upload-size = ${?PHOTO_MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE}
    max-thumbnail-size = 100KiB
    max-thumbnail-size = ${?PHOTO_MAX_THUMBNAIL_SIZE}
  }
}
```

- The unqualified line is the fixed default; the `${?VAR}` line beneath an overridable field replaces it only when that variable is set — HOCON's own optional-substitution rule, not custom code.
- Fixed fields have no matching line, so no variable can influence them.

## Alternatives Considered

- Typesafe Config, used directly with hand-written per-field parsing: rejected. Every field would need its own hand-written conversion and validation code.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Every overridable field takes its default when its environment variable is unset or empty — matches today's behavior exactly.
- An override outside its bound fails startup, naming the field and the rejected value. A minimum sample count below 2 is one such rejected value.
- Minimum sample count above the configured history size (or vice versa) fails startup, regardless of either value's own bound.
- A configured history size above 20 is honored exactly, with no upper limit.
- Every renamed environment variable (host, port) keeps its current default and override behavior under its new name.
- Database file path, photos directory, and static assets directory keep their current effective value, but no longer accept an environment override — setting their old environment variable has no effect.
- Setting none of the new environment variables changes nothing observable — this change alone is a no-op until an operator opts in.
- `/health`'s response body reports only a liveness status; it carries no version field.
- No environment variable, config field, or response body reports an application version anywhere.

## Doc Sync

- `specs/operational.md` — Runtime dependencies: name every environment-variable configuration input (renamed host/port, plus the new watering/attention/photo thresholds) with its current default and bound; state that the database file path, photos directory, and static assets directory are fixed, not environment-configurable.
- `unraid/README.md` — post-update verification: replace the `/health` version check in the verification and recovery steps, since the response no longer carries a version.

## Out of Scope

- Frontend-side limits that duplicate these backend values (upload size, accepted image types, photo page size) — maintained independently, not addressed here.
- No runtime reconfiguration path; changing any value still requires restarting the service.
